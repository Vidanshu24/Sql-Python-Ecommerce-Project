#  Ecommerce Analysis Project (SQL + Python)

This project analyzes an E-commerce dataset using SQL queries executed through Python, with insights visualized using pandas. It focuses on understanding customer behavior, order patterns, and category-wise sales using relational data analysis.

---

## Project Overview

This is a data analysis project using:
- **MYSQL** to run SQL queries on ecommerce data
- **Python** to connect to the database, process results, and build DataFrames
- **Jupyter Notebook** for a clean and documented workflow

##  Business Questions Answered

The notebook answers several ecommerce-related business questions, including:

- What are all the unique cities customers are from?
- How many orders were placed in the year 2017?
- What is the total sales per product category?
- What are the top customers by order count or value?
- ...and more!
